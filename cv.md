## About myself
I am a beginner developer who is always tries to learn something new. I love to code, it really gives me pleasure. Even if there are problems that are not easy to solve, I will deal with it and doesn't matter how much time I will spend.
Speaking about my personal qualities, I would like to note, I am a purposeful and very stress-resistant person, who is not used to giving up.  Although my experience does not quite fit the IT sphere, it still gives me some advantage:
* I learned Chinese - it made me understood nothing is impossible in the world. 
* For a long time I lived in a foreign country, with a completely different mentality - it developed my communication skills. 
* I worked in logistics - it prepared me to meet any deadlines. 
I can continue this list for a very long time, but in my opinion it is enough to note, that I am ready to always learning and growing in order to be an excellent front-end developer.
